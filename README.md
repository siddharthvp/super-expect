## super-expect


Adapted from https://gist.github.com/0xR/9232db946e3198ef619168a33a92232d#file-setup-test-framework-script-js

[Jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest) configuration to setup the global `expect` that combines both jest expect and [chai](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chai) expect. To top it up, [jest-extended](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest-extended), [chai-as-promised](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chai-as-promised), [chai-string](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chai-string) and [chai-datetime](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chai-datetime) are also smashed in, to give an all-powerful `expect`!
